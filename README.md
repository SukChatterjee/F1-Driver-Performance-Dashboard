# F1 Driver Performance Dashboard (Tableau) — 2014–2024

Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Formula 1 driver performance from **2014 to 2024**, connecting **qualifying pace** (Saturday) to **race outcomes** (Sunday) with driver-level KPIs, trends, and distributions.

---

## Overview

This project contains my **F1 Driver Performance Dashboard** built in **Tableau** to explore how drivers perform across seasons using qualifying position, finishing position, wins, points, DNFs, and consistency metrics. The dashboard is designed to be **driver-selectable**, so all visuals update dynamically for any chosen driver.

---

## What the Dashboard Helps Answer

- Does **qualifying position** correlate with **race finish position** for a driver?
- How do a driver’s **wins change season-by-season**?
- How often does a driver **gain vs lose positions** during races?
- What is the driver’s overall **consistency**, **top-10 finish rate**, and **average points per race**?
- How do driver career stats (races, podiums, DNFs) translate into performance outcomes?
